Version 0.3
============

- In case preprocess is unavailable, print message and continue, do not exit.

- CODE gives an error, not throw an exception, when 'to' or 'from' 
  are not found.

- Added a space character after \noindent so that one can write a string
  immidiately after: '\noindentThis is important'

- Added a way to define wether an environment should be defined every time
  it is used, it should be defined once per file or if it defined somewhere
  else (main .tex file)

- Add support for defining LaTeX environments for multiple, instead  of
  assuming they are defined in an external file (when using define=False in
  the config file). Note that the names of environments can only contain
  letters, hence shaded2 is not valid unless shaded is undefined.
