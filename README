Installing ptex2tex
===================

Installing latexslides is done by

python setup.py install

with the usual Distutils options available.

The next sections are for those who know Distutils and LaTeX, and explains 
how to make LaTeX know about the style files that come the ptex2tex. 
If this gets too complicated, there are two options that should be quite 
simple:
1) copy the contents of the folder latex to the folder you are running
ptex2tex from
2) add the folder latex to the environment variable TEXINPUTS, here
demonstrated for the Bash shell: 

export TEXINPUTS=:.:/path/to/style_files:$TEXINPUTS

Note the first semi-colon; it ensures that the systemwide directories are
searched first.

Location of LaTeX files
=======================

As part of ptex2tex, a style file (ptex2tex.sty) and several Encapsulated
Postscript file (*.eps) are provided
in the folder 'latex'. When running the above installation command,
the style files are written to
os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'share', 'texmf', 'tex', 'latex', 'ptex2tex').
How latex will find the files when running is explained in the next section.

Here, os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'foo', 'bar') is Python code and results in 
the directory /usr/foo/bar on Linux, assuming Python is installed in /usr

The location of the files can be changed in the following ways:

python setup.py install --install-data=/foo

The style files are now written to
os.path.join('/foo', 'share', 'texmf', 'tex', 'latex', 'ptex2tex')

python setup.py install --home=/bar

and

python setup.py install --prefix=/bar

work as usual, the style files are then written to
os.path.join('/bar', 'share', 'texmf', 'tex', 'latex', 'ptex2tex')
as well. Notice that when using --home and --prefix, not only the LaTeX 
files, but also all other package files are affected, see the Distutils 
manual.

Note that the option --install-data only works for the latex files, and
overwrite the options --home and --prefix for these files if it is given in
addition to those (as it should).

If none of these options behaves as required (for instance, you would like 
to install them to $HOME/texmf), then the variable 'latex_dir' in setup.py 
should be set to this directory.

Making sure LaTeX finds the files at runtime
============================================

After the script finishes, you should make sure that the latex command can
find the files. If the files are located in one of the directories where 
LaTeX knows about them, it should suffice to run the following command:

texconfig rehash

To check which directories are available to LaTeX, you can use one of the
following two commands:

texconfig conf

or

kpsepath tex

As a last resort, it is possible to set the environment variable TEXINPUTS,
see the first section of this file.

Authors
=======
ptex2tex is based on a package called ctex2tex, 
developed by Hans Petter Langtangen. 
Ilmar Wilbers redesigned and reimplemented that package. New features were
also added. Both authors work at Simula Research Laboratory in Norway,
