- Add changes made for 0.31 to documentation:
  - '~' for space in CODE/DATA
  - New section 'inline_code' in ConfigFile.
  - Support for preprocess commandline arguments in ConfigFile (own section).
  - Check for names in renewenvironments.
  - Testconfig.py.
  - Warning for space in front of environment keys, do not delete temp
    files.

- Testconfig.py should not be executable, instead called when running
ptex2tex --test or similar.

- Change the name of the classes for the environment from their
  original names to names describing their looks, the way it is now is
  confusing. This goes also for the temporary names within the LaTeX code.

- Implement the possibility of having @@@CODE and the like inside environments 
  without the file actually being included. ctex2tex has a variable insidebc 
  that is set and checked.

- Add arguments to the beginning statements of ptex2tex environments, 
  such that the header for Warnings, Rules, Summation and MatlabA can be 
  set.

- Add possibility for defining what environments are used with @@@CODE, @@@DATA
  and @@@CMD in configuration file.

- Add possibility for setting the default vale for the integer following the
  character '#' in @@@CMD in the configuration file.

- Add support for preprocessor's commandline arguments.

- CODE does not except regex, one has to write 'def func(' instead of 
  'def func\(': less backwards compability (ctex2tex). Add option --regex
  so that ptex2tex using regex instead of line.search

- Add functionality in @@@CMD to strip lines with reverse sign \r
    >>> d.split('\r')
    ['time=4', 'time=5']
    >>> d.split('\r')[-1]
    'time=5'

- Add functionality to strip code text in @@@CODE (try/except and 
  __debug__-blocks.
  
- Windows: Add ptex2tex.bat
  Can be automated, see setup.py file for Instant.

- doc: Add documentation for \code and \emp.
